    Declarative description of what a consumer (attack, converter, scorer)
    requires from a target.

    The single source of truth for capability names is the
    :class:`CapabilityName` enum; this class is simply a typed wrapper
    around the set of capabilities a consumer needs.

    Two tiers of requirement are supported:

    * ``required`` \u2014 satisfied either by native support on the target or
      by an ``ADAPT`` entry in the target's
      :class:`CapabilityHandlingPolicy`. Use this when the consumer only
      needs the behavior to appear on the wire.
    * ``native_required`` \u2014 must be natively supported. Adaptation is
      rejected. Use this when adaptation would silently change the
      consumer's semantics (e.g. an attack that depends on the target
      remembering prior turns, where history-squash normalization would
      collapse the conversation into a single prompt).

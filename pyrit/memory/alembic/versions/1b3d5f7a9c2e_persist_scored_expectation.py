"""
Persist the full scoring expectation instead of a bare objective.

``ScoreEntries.objective`` held only the objective string a score was judged against.
``ScoreEntries.scored_expectation`` records the complete versioned expectation (objective
plus any typed conditions), so a persisted score keeps the whole of what it was scored
for. On upgrade the legacy objective is folded into an objective-only expectation; on
downgrade only the objective survives and typed conditions are dropped.

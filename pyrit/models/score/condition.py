    What counts as satisfied.

    A condition is a neutral predicate about evidence: it says what to detect, never
    whether detecting it is good or bad. Polarity belongs to a scorer that wraps another,
    such as ``TrueFalseInverterScorer``. Each scoring domain adds its own subclass.

    A concrete subclass declares a ``condition_type`` field as a single-value ``Literal`` with
    a matching default. That default is the stable discriminator persisted with the condition
    and carried in REST payloads, so the type survives serialization without its import path.

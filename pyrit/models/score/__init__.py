Score types: what a scorer looks at, what it scores against, and the result.

A scorer takes two inputs — a ``Scorable`` (what to look at) and a
``ScoringExpectation`` (what to look for) — and returns ``Score`` objects. Scorables
are inert canonical data; scoring-layer resolvers acquire the evidence they name.

    Strongly-typed projection of a ``PromptTarget``'s ``ComponentIdentifier``.

    Promotes the common target params to typed fields; any other params stay in
    ``params``. Capabilities are not part of identity and are not surfaced here.

    Promotes the one child slot a target owns in its own constructor:
    ``targets`` (inner targets of a multi-target like ``RoundRobinTarget``),
    typed recursively as ``TargetIdentifier``.

    ``Evaluate.*`` markers declare the behavioral projection used for the eval
    hash: operational params (``endpoint`` / ``model_name`` /
    ``max_requests_per_minute``) are excluded, ``underlying_model_name`` falls
    back to ``model_name``, and ``targets`` is a wrapper passthrough that is
    unwrapped so a multi-target hashes the same as its inner target.

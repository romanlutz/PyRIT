CLI-side data sources for the ``pyrit.output`` printers.

The thin REST client can't use the framework's ``CentralMemory``-backed sources,
so this module supplies a ``ConversationSource`` that hydrates ``pyrit.models``
objects from the ``/messages`` view JSON and serves the objective score inline
(no extra endpoint). It lives here — not in ``pyrit.output`` — so the framework
output layer never imports ``pyrit.cli``.

Guard localhost-only publication of local Docker services.

These tests check Compose configuration, not runtime network isolation.
On Docker Engine versions older than 28.0.0, passing a LAN-address check does not
rule out same-L2 access to localhost-published ports; upgrade Docker or retain
network-level ingress restrictions.

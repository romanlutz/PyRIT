What PyRIT Offers

## Key Capabilities

:::::{grid} 1 2 3 3

::::{card}
🎯 **Automated Red Teaming**

Run multi-turn attack strategies like Crescendo, TAP, and Skeleton Key against AI systems with minimal setup. Single-turn and multi-turn attacks supported out of the box.
::::

::::{card}
📦 **Scenario Framework**

Run standardized evaluation scenarios at large scale — covering content harms, psychosocial risks, data leakage, and more. Compose strategies and datasets for repeatable, comprehensive assessments across hundreds of objectives.

::::{card}
🖥️ **CoPyRIT**

A graphical user interface for human-led red teaming. Interact with AI systems directly, track findings, and collaborate with your team — all from a modern web UI.
::::

::::{card}
🔌 **Any Target**

Test OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace, custom HTTP endpoints or WebSockets, web app targets with Playwright, or build your own with a simple interface.
::::

::::{card}
💾 **Built-in Memory**

Track all conversations, scores, and attack results with SQLite or Azure SQL. Export, analyze, and share results with your team.
::::

::::{card}
📊 **Flexible Scoring**

Evaluate AI responses with true/false, Likert scale, classification, and custom scorers — powered by LLMs, Azure AI Content Safety, or your own logic.

# # Scoring
# %% [markdown]
# Scoring evaluates what happened to a prompt. It is how PyRIT answers questions like:
#
# - Was prompt injection detected?
# - Was the prompt blocked? Why?
# - Was there harmful content in the response? How bad was it?
#
# A scorer takes a response (or a whole conversation) and returns one or more
# [`Score`](../../../pyrit/models/score.py) objects. Scorers are used three ways:
# directly (this page), automatically inside an [attack](../executor/1_single_turn.ipynb#prompt-sending),
# and over many stored responses with the [batch scorer](#batch-scoring).
#
# ## The two return types
#
# Every concrete scorer returns one of two score types:
#
# - **`true_false`** — a boolean. Good for success criteria ("did the attack succeed?"),
#   refusal detection, and policy checks. `score.get_value()` returns a `bool`.
# - **`float_scale`** — a number normalized to `0.0`–`1.0`. Good for quantifying *how much*
#   of something is present (e.g. severity of harmful content). `score.get_value()` returns a `float`.
#
# The two are convertible: a `float_scale` score becomes `true_false` by applying a
# threshold (see [Combining & stacking scorers](3_combining_scorers.ipynb)).
# %% [markdown]
# ## Scorer reference table
#
# Every concrete scorer, grouped by return type. The table is generated from
# `get_scorer_info()`, which inspects each scorer class without instantiating it.

# ## The class hierarchy
#
# `Scorer` separates the evidence to inspect from the result family. `TrueFalseScorer` and
# `FloatScaleScorer` define the two result families. `MessageScorer` adds message resolution
# and message-only policy. Most built-in scorers combine one result-family base with
# `MessageScorer`.

#
# `ConversationScorer` is never instantiated directly. `create_conversation_scorer()`
# accepts a `MessageTrueFalseScorer` or `MessageFloatScaleScorer` and builds a compatible
# subclass that evaluates a whole conversation.
#
# Generic family scorers consume a `Scorable` without assuming that it resolves to a
# message. Message scorers also support message-specific entry points and policy. Generic
# wrappers do not inherit those message APIs from their children; use their canonical
# `score_async(scorable=..., expectation=...)` entry point. See
# [Combining & stacking scorers](3_combining_scorers.ipynb).
# %% [markdown]
# ## Evidence and score status
#
# A `Scorable` identifies what a scorer evaluates. `MessageScorable` refers to message pieces
# in memory. `ContentScorable` carries loose text or media. When a file-backed
# `ContentScorable` is persisted with a score, PyRIT copies the file to configured results
# storage and stores its SHA-256 digest. The score remains resolvable after the source file is
# removed.
#
# Target-backed scorers over text evidence also persist an `Observation` that references and hashes
# the retained response in the SCORE conversation. The observation and its first score are
# committed together. Capture requires durable scored evidence. A custom general-scorer template
# that reads `message_piece` fields does not emit an observation for a loose `ContentScorable`.
# In-hand messages keep their score-to-message links when storage rounds timestamps. Observation
# evidence checks remain exact: a content-only snapshot cannot replay a metadata-dependent judgment.
# `Score.scored_expectation` records the complete expectation used for the verdict, while
# `Score.objective` remains a read-only compatibility view. `score_observation_async()` can
# parse that stored judgment again without calling the target. Replay requires unchanged scored
# evidence and response content, plus the exact original expectation, scorer configuration, and
# response-handler contract. `ScorerTargetResponsePayload` references the scorer's target response;
# the target need not be a language model. Its kind is `scorer_target_response`.
# Media observation capture remains deferred until its evidence can be snapshotted.
# Trace-backed tool observations are covered in [Tool-call scoring](5_tool_call_scorer.ipynb).
#
# Replaying a judgment is different from evaluating a stored run against a new expectation.
# A retained target judgment answers the original expectation; changing that expectation
# requires a new judgment, not just parsing the old response. Use
# `score_async(scorable=stored_scorable, expectation=new_expectation)` to evaluate the same
# stored attack evidence again. This does not rerun the attack, but a target-backed scorer
# calls its scoring target again. The exact-expectation restriction applies to judgment
# observations, not to the general `Scorer` contract.
#
# Replay is an explicit contract for each concrete class, not an inherited promise.
# A custom scorer declares `_judgment_replay_identifier()` and shares pure judgment logic
# between live scoring and `_score_judgment_observation()` (for example, in `_convert_score()`).
# Async-only postprocessing is not replayed. A custom response handler declares
# `_replay_identifier()`. Both identifiers must include a behavior version and every added
# setting that changes the judgment or parsing. Subclasses without their own declaration
# can still capture observations, but replay raises `NonReplayableObservationError`.
#
# Deleting a score through `memory.get_session()` and ORM `session.delete()` removes its
# observation only after the final score reference is gone. Removing an ORM observation link
# also triggers this cleanup, including when a collection is cleared before its score is deleted.
# Cleanup uses persisted links and removed relationship history, not just cached collections.
# Cleanup and the reference removal share one transaction; shared observations remain available.
# Bulk SQL deletes do not use this ORM cleanup path.
#
# Response helpers accept `expectation=`; their bare `objective=` input is deprecated until 2.0.
# Each scorer tree must support every condition it receives. Typed leaves require exactly one
# condition of their declared type; constructor-configured leaves accept no conditions.
# Composites validate coverage and send each child only its supported conditions, preserving
# objective context. The child judgment records that subset; the composite verdict records the
# complete expectation. Leaves cannot read sibling conditions.
# Objective-only calls default to `MatchesObjective` when the scorer tree needs it. Other typed
# criteria are never defaulted, and explicit nonempty condition lists are not extended.
# In `MessageScorer.score_response_async`, the objective scorer alone owns required coverage.
# Auxiliary scorers receive supported subsets; a typed auxiliary missing a required condition
# is skipped as a whole. Constructor-configured diagnostics still run with objective context.
# Errors from selected auxiliaries remain visible. Each root persists its own scores/observations.
# Generic flat helpers require each root to accept the complete expectation independently.
# Use an explicit composite when different judges jointly evaluate the supplied conditions.
# `Scorer.score_with_scorers_async` accepts optional `scorer_roles`, one per scorer, for execution
# context. Its result lists follow scorer input order, including empty lists.
#
# Scoring APIs return `list[Score]`. An empty list means that the scorer does not apply to the
# evidence, such as a message with no supported role or data type. A non-empty list contains
# completed or undetermined scores.
#
# A complete score has `status="complete"` and a typed domain verdict. An undetermined score
# has `status="undetermined"` and no value because supported evidence failed to load. A fully
# blocked response is a complete negative result by default: `False` for message true/false
# scorers and `0.0` for message float-scale scorers. `SelfAskRefusalScorer` is the intentional
# exception because a content-filter block is a refusal, so it returns `True`.
#
# A scorer declares which evidence it reads; the caller does not filter evidence on its behalf.
# A message scorer names the conversation roles it reads with `supported_roles` on its
# `ScorerPromptValidator`. Prepended (`simulated_assistant`) turns are fabricated history, so a
# scorer must opt in to read them. Every scorer still receives a failed response, because a
# scorer whose evidence never came from the response must run even when the response failed.
# Explicit `role_filter` and `skip_on_error_result` values remain supported until removal.
# Callers that rely on their historical defaults must now pass them explicitly. New code
# should use `supported_roles` and the scorer's unreadable-evidence fallback instead.

# ## Scoring directly
#
# The smallest example: a local `SubStringScorer` (a `true_false` scorer) over a string.
# No model call, no credentials.

# ## Scoring inside an attack
#
# Most of the time a scorer is handed to an attack as the **objective scorer** that decides
# whether the objective was met. Here a `SubStringScorer` and a local `TextTarget` keep the
# example offline. `TextTarget` just records the prompt and returns no assistant content, so
# there is nothing substantive for the scorer to flag — swap in an LLM-backed
# [target](../targets/0_prompt_targets.md) (and any scorer) to score a real model response.

# ## Batch scoring
#
# `BatchScorer` scores responses already in memory — for example everything an attack sent.
# It runs in parallel and can select responses by conversation, prompt id, memory labels,
# timestamps, and more. It works with any scorer; here we reuse the local `SubStringScorer`.

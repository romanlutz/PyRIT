# # Trace-backed tool-call scoring
#
# `OtelToolCallScorer` answers "Did these tools run?" It matches exact,
# case-sensitive names in execution spans, not claims in a response or
# model-proposed calls. A failed execution attempt counts; the scorer does not
# check tool success, arguments, order, or call count.
#
# Supply the trace IDs explicitly. This first version does not discover traces
# from messages or act as an automatic attack outcome scorer.
#
# The OpenTelemetry SDK is included with PyRIT. This walkthrough uses a real SDK provider,
# local capture, and PyRIT's in-memory storage. It needs no model, service, credentials, or global
# provider changes.

# shortened names cannot prove which tools ran, even with incomplete coverage.
#
# This example has no background work and uses always-on sampling. Both spans
# have ended, so after checking export we can declare this controlled capture
# complete. A flush alone would not prove that an arbitrary remote trace is
# complete.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Use another trace source
#
# A caller can provide a `TraceClient` that returns neutral spans for the
# requested trace IDs and reports coverage honestly. `OtelTraceSource` handles
# supported GenAI/OpenInference execution spans; matching remains backend-neutral.
# A client reports `TraceQueryResult(available=False)` when it knows no evidence
# can be retrieved, such as after retention expires. This produces an unavailable
# observation and an undetermined score. Pending capture stays available with
# incomplete coverage; an empty result alone does not mean unavailable.
# Optional empty call IDs are omitted; they do not prevent name-only scoring.
#
# `ObservationSource[TraceScorable]` is the source contract for this scorer.
# Other sources can use the same protocol with their own scorable types.
# The caller owns instrumentation and trace IDs. No backend adapters or automatic
# HTTP context propagation are included in this first version.

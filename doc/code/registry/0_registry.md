# Registry

Registries in PyRIT provide a centralized way to discover, manage, and access components. They support lazy loading, singleton access, and metadata introspection.

## Why Registries?

- **Discovery**: Automatically find available components (scenarios, scorers, etc.)
- **Consistency**: Access components through a uniform API
- **Metadata**: Inspect what's available without instantiating everything
- **Extensibility**: Register custom components alongside built-in ones

## Two Types of Registries

PyRIT has two registry patterns for different use cases:

| Type | Stores | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Class Registry** | Classes (type[T]) | Components instantiated with user-provided parameters |
| **Instance Registry** | Pre-configured instances | Components requiring complex setup before use |

## Common API

Class catalogs share an interface for discovery and metadata:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `get_registry_singleton()` | Get the singleton registry instance |
| `get_class_names()` | List all registered class names |
| `get_all_registered_class_metadata()` | Get constructor metadata for registered classes |
| `reset_registry_singleton()` | Reset the singleton (useful for testing) |

Registries that also store configured objects expose `get_names()` and
`list_metadata()` through `.instances`.

This makes it easy to write code that inspects any registry:

```python
from pyrit.registry import ScenarioRegistry


def show_registry_contents(registry) -> None:
    for name in registry.get_class_names():
        print(name)


show_registry_contents(ScenarioRegistry.get_registry_singleton())
```


## Key Difference with Class and Instance Registries

| Aspect | Class Registry | Instance Registry |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Stores | Classes (type[T]) | Instances (T) |
| Registration | Automatic discovery | Explicit via `register()` |
| Returns | Class to instantiate | Ready-to-use instance |
| Instantiation | Caller provides parameters | Pre-configured by initializer |
| When to use | Self-contained components with deferred configuration | Components requiring constructor parameters or compositional setup |

## Named Component Construction

Converter, target, and scorer registries use `InstanceHoldingRegistry` to build
components and store them in their `.instances` registry. Use
`create_named_instance(name=..., type_name=..., params=...)` to build and register
a component in one operation. The instance registry stores objects; it does not
construct them.

Duplicate names raise `ValueError`. Use `.instances.register(..., replace=True)`
only when replacement is intended. Converter and target registries also reject
reserved route names such as `catalog` and `types`. Use `.instances.unregister(name)`
to remove an instance.

The instance registry checks and inserts each name under one lock. Concurrent
creation can build more than one component for the same name, but only one
registration succeeds unless replacement is requested. The backend does not
need a separate registration lock.

Constructor annotations define parameter metadata and coercion. Enum parameters
accept member names or values. Types that inherit `StructuredParameterValue` declare their
allowed variants through `get_registry_input_variants()`; the registry
derives each variant's constructor fields and accepts `{ "type": "<name>",
"parameters": { ... } }`. Word-selection strategies use this shared mechanism.
Both enums and structured inputs also accept existing Python objects. Use `Path` for a
local file input. Use `Path | str` when a component also supports a remote URL.
For this union, the registry preserves the supplied type: a `Path` stays a `Path`,
and a string stays a string. It never passes a URL through `Path`. Both union
orders have the same metadata, `type_name: "Path | str"`, including after a JSON
round-trip. Optional forms accept `None` in Python; the display type omits `None`,
as it does for other optional parameters.

The backend exposes scorer types at `GET /api/scorers/types`, lists registered
instances at `GET /api/scorers`, retrieves one at `GET /api/scorers/{name}`, and
creates one with `POST /api/scorers` (`name`, `type`, and optional `params`). The
type response uses the registry's shared `Parameter` contract. Instance responses
include the complete `ScorerIdentifier`, including nested scorer and target
identifiers; target identifiers apply their existing credential-exclusion rules.
Construction and reference resolution remain owned by `ScorerRegistry`.
Scorer list responses build identifiers only for the requested page. Runtime
replacement clears the cached scorer service so requests use the new registry.

The backend owns file-upload handling and cleanup, not the registry. See the
[registry API migration notes](../../gui/0_gui.md#registry-api-migration-notes)
for the REST contract and temporary compatibility behavior.

## Attack Class Registry

`AttackRegistry` discovers concrete `AttackStrategy` classes from
`pyrit.executor.attack`. It stores classes, not live attack instances, and has no
`.instances` property. Discovery works when `AttackTechniqueRegistry` is empty.
Discovery and constructor metadata do not construct attacks or call targets.

Use `get_class_names()`, `get_class()`, and
`get_all_registered_class_metadata()` to inspect the class catalog. Use
`register_class(CustomAttack, name="custom")` to add a custom class.
`get_registry_singleton()` returns the shared registry;
`reset_registry_singleton()` clears it. PyRIT setup also resets this registry.

After PyRIT initialization, build an attack with constructor arguments:

```python
from pyrit.executor.attack import AttackConverterConfig
from pyrit.registry import AttackRegistry, TargetRegistry

# objective_target is an existing configured target.
TargetRegistry.get_registry_singleton().instances.register(objective_target, name="objective")
attack = AttackRegistry.get_registry_singleton().create_instance(
    "PromptSendingAttack",
    objective_target="objective",
    attack_converter_config=AttackConverterConfig(),
    max_attempts_on_failure=1,
)
```

`objective_target` accepts a registered target name or a live target object.
Simple scalar inputs use the shared resolver. Pass live Python configuration
objects, such as `AttackAdversarialConfig`, `AttackConverterConfig`, and
`AttackScoringConfig`, for nested components. Advanced Python values, such as a
prompt normalizer or a parameter class, pass through unchanged. Nested JSON
attack recipes are not supported.

An attack class implements the conversation algorithm. An attack technique
factory selects and configures that class, converters, scorers, and seeds.
`AttackTechniqueRegistry` continues to store those factories separately.

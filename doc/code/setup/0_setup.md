# Setup

PyRIT setup involves three main components to get you started with security testing:

1. **Configuration** - Initialize PyRIT with environment variables, database, and defaults
2. **Resiliency** - Understand retry mechanisms and error handling
3. **Customization** - Learn about default values and custom initializers

## Quick Start

For the fastest setup, use `TargetInitializer` and `ScorerInitializer`, which require only basic OpenAI environment variables:

```python
from pyrit.setup import initialize_pyrit_async
from pyrit.setup.initializers import ScorerInitializer, TargetInitializer

await initialize_pyrit_async(memory_db_type="InMemory", initializers=[TargetInitializer(), ScorerInitializer()])
```

This configuration allows you to run most PyRIT notebooks immediately.

## Configuration Options

PyRIT offers flexible configuration through:
- **Environment variables** for API keys and endpoints
- **Database options** including InMemory, SQLite, and Azure SQL
- **Custom initializers** for project-specific defaults

See the detailed sections below for comprehensive setup guidance.

## Reinitializing a running backend

The CoPyRIT configuration page separates **Save** from **Reinitialize PyRIT**.
On a single-process, single-replica backend, administrators can apply saved
configuration, environment documents, and custom initializer scripts without
restarting Python. The saved `.pyrit_conf` must set `enable_live_reinitialization: true`.
See [the GUI reinitialization guide](../../gui/0_gui.md) for status, failure behavior, and deployment limits.

The backend first validates the saved sources without changing live setup state. It rejects live apply while any
runtime work is active. When the runtime is idle, it closes admission, checks for work again, and then rebuilds
setup-owned registries and defaults. The replacement reuses the same memory object, which preserves in-memory and
persisted history.
Memory type, connection, or storage changes require a process restart.
Library callers must provide their own admission and idle-runtime boundary
before using this configuration-level reinitialization path.

Reinitialization explicitly replaces process environment values supplied by the
selected sources, including deployment-provided values. Omitted variables remain;
there is no historical tracking or removal. Key Vault selection and `.env.local`
priority still apply, and interpolation uses newly selected values. Ordinary
initialization retains its existing environment precedence. The lower-level
`initialize_pyrit_async(reinitialize=True)` option provides replacement values and
memory reuse; `ConfigurationLoader` owns the complete registry/script rebuild.

Failure after mutation blocks backend runtime operations until a process restart.
Configuration repair stays available under the original authorization policy.
Initializer side effects and environment updates are not rolled back.

# Memory

PyRIT's memory component allows users to track and manage a history of interactions throughout an attack scenario. This feature enables the storage, retrieval, and sharing of conversation entries, making it easier to maintain context and continuity in ongoing interactions.

To simplify memory interaction, the `pyrit.memory.CentralMemory` class automatically manages a shared memory instance across all components in a session. Memory must be set explicitly.

**Manual Memory Setting**:

At the beginning of each notebook, make sure to call:
```python
from pyrit.memory import CentralMemory
from pyrit.setup import IN_MEMORY, initialize_pyrit_async

await initialize_pyrit_async(memory_db_type=IN_MEMORY)
memory = CentralMemory.get_memory_instance()
messages = await memory.get_conversation_messages_async(conversation_id="example")
```

Use the `_async` memory methods in async code. The synchronous methods remain
available during deprecation. In-memory SQLite serializes transactions across
threads and event loops to prevent shared-cache table locks.

Repeated initialization reuses the existing memory without running schema setup
again. Setup raises an error if `CentralMemory` and the requested backend singleton
disagree, or if setup tries to change an existing SQLite instance between in-memory
and persistent modes.

Do not overlap synchronous and async sessions on the same event-loop thread.
In-memory SQLite raises an error instead of blocking that loop. Use async methods
for concurrent work on an event loop.

Before an event loop stops, call `await memory.dispose_loop_resources_async()`
on that loop. After all memory work stops, call `await memory.dispose_engine_async()`
to close the remaining resources.

The `MemoryDatabaseType` is a `Literal` with 3 options: IN_MEMORY, SQLITE, AZURE_SQL. (Read more below)
   - `initialize_pyrit_async` takes the `MemoryDatabaseType` and an argument list (`memory_instance_kwargs`), to initialize the shared memory instance.

##  Memory Database Type Options

**IN_MEMORY:** _In-Memory SQLite Database_
   - This option can be preferable if the user does not care about storing conversations or scores in memory beyond the current process. It is used as the default in most of the PyRIT notebooks.
   - **Note**: In in-memory mode, no data is persisted to disk, therefore, all data is lost when the process finishes

**SQLITE:** _Persistent SQLite Database_
   - Interactions will be stored in a persistent `SQLiteMemory` instance with a location on-disk. See notebook [here](./1_sqlite_memory.ipynb) for more details.

**AZURE_SQL:** _Azure SQL Database_
   - For examples on setting up `AzureSQLMemory`, please refer to the notebook [here](./7_azure_sql_memory_attacks.ipynb).
   - To configure AzureSQLMemory without an extra argument list, these keys should be in your `.env` file:
     - `AZURE_SQL_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`
     - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_DB_DATA_CONTAINER_URL`

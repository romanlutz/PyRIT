# Prompt Targets

Prompt Targets are endpoints for where to send prompts. For example, a target could be a GPT-4 or Llama endpoint. Targets are typically used with other components like [attacks](../executor/0_executor.md), [scorers](../scoring/0_scoring.ipynb), and [converters](../converters/0_converters.ipynb).

- An attack's main job is to change prompts to a given format, apply any converters, and then send them off to prompt targets (sometimes using various strategies). Within an attack, prompt targets are (mostly) swappable, meaning you can use the same logic with different target endpoints.
- A scorer's main job is to score a prompt. Often, these use LLMs, in which case, a given scorer can often use different configured targets.
- A converter's job is to transform a prompt. Often, these use LLMs, in which case, a given converter can use different configured targets.

Prompt targets are found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT/tree/main/pyrit/prompt_target/) in code.


## `send_prompt_async`

The main entry method has the following signature:

```python
async def send_prompt_async(
    self,
    *,
    message: Message,
    send_context: TargetSendContext | None = None,
) -> list[Message]:
```

A `Message` object contains the current request and the identifiers needed to load its conversation
history. This is discussed in more depth [here](../memory/3_memory_data_types.md).

`send_context` is an internal protocol that lets caller-owned execution state select persisted history
and observe when target-specific execution begins. Attacks with prepended history own the concrete
`PrependedHistorySendContext`; targets do not construct it, clone it, or decide whether its seed should
be replayed. Before target-specific execution, `PromptTarget` loads memory history, asks the protocol for the
caller-approved target view, and then runs the target's capability-normalization pipeline. Request
converters have already run by this point, so role-specific converter choices remain intact even when
the target must receive one flattened request. The context is ephemeral and does not replace the
structured messages stored in memory.

Prepended request converters apply only to `user` messages by default. Every other role, including
`system`, `developer`, `tool`, and `assistant` / `simulated_assistant`, requires explicit opt-in.

For a stateful target without editable history, the initial bootstrap is flattened once. Later sends
retain replayable memory history in the normalized view so a target such as `WebsocketTarget` can
restore a replaced provider session, while the existing provider session still receives only the
current request. A stateful TAP clone bootstraps its new provider session with the complete replayable
duplicated branch, even when the attack started without an explicit prepended seed. Stateless targets
continue to receive only the explicit prepended seed plus each current request, never prior live branch
turns. A stateful TAP target without editable history can flatten only text converter output when
branching; non-text converter output requires an editable-history target, a stateless target, or
`branching_factor=1` so copied media is never replayed under a different role.

`PromptTarget` records one target invocation immediately before calling
`_send_prompt_to_target_async`. This framework-owned boundary is not a target capability or a
subclass-managed flag. A stateful target consumes one-time bootstrap history only after that call
returns successfully; normalization failures, target errors, and cancellation retain it for retry.
Target-side rate limiting remains independent and continues to use `limit_requests_per_minute`.

`send_prompt_async` is the final public orchestration method. Custom target subclasses implement
`_send_prompt_to_target_async(*, normalized_conversation: list[Message]) -> list[Message]` instead of
overriding `send_prompt_async`.

## Chat-style targets vs general targets

A `PromptTarget` is a generic place to send a prompt. With PyRIT, the idea is that it will eventually be consumed by an AI application, but that doesn't have to be immediate. For example, you could have a SharePoint target. Everything you send a prompt to is a `PromptTarget`. Many attacks work generically with any `PromptTarget` including `RedTeamingAttack` and `PromptSendingAttack`.

With some algorithms, you want to send a prompt, set a system prompt, and modify conversation history (including PAIR [@chao2023pair], TAP [@mehrotra2023tap], and flip attack [@liu2024flipattack]). These algorithms require a target whose [`TargetCapabilities`](#target-capabilities) declare both `supports_multi_turn=True` and `supports_editable_history=True` — i.e. you can modify a conversation history. Consumers express this requirement via `CHAT_TARGET_REQUIREMENTS` and validate it against `target.configuration` at construction time. See [Target Capabilities](#target-capabilities) below for the full list of capabilities and how they compose into a `TargetConfiguration`.

Note: The previous `PromptChatTarget` class has been **removed**. Use `PromptTarget` directly with a `TargetConfiguration` declaring `supports_multi_turn=True` and `supports_editable_history=True`. See [Target Capabilities](#target-capabilities) for details.


Here are some examples:

| Example                             | Chat-style target?                                | Notes                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OpenAIChatTarget** (e.g., GPT-4)  | **Yes** (multi-turn + editable history)           | Designed for conversational prompts (system messages, conversation history, etc.).               |
| **OpenAIImageTarget**               | **No**                                            | Used for image generation; does not manage conversation history.                                 |
| **HTTPTarget**                      | **No**                                            | Generic HTTP target. Some apps might allow conversation history, but this target doesn't handle it. |
| **A2ATarget**                       | **No** (multi-turn, but no editable history)     | Text-only Agent-to-Agent endpoints through the official a2a-sdk (v0.3 / v1.0).                |
| **AzureBlobStorageTarget**          | **No**                                            | Used primarily for storage; not for conversation-based AI.                                       |

## A2A agents

Install the optional client with `pip install "pyrit[a2a]"` (also included in
`pyrit[all]`). `A2ATarget` uses the official `a2a-sdk` 1.x client for JSON-RPC.
Set `protocol_version="0.3"` (the default) or `"1.0"` for a known endpoint.
Set `"auto"` to discover the agent card. Discovery errors are not hidden by
a fallback to another protocol. Use `agent_card_path` for a non-standard
relative card path.

The adapter sends one text piece per turn. The agent owns its context and
history. The target cannot edit or replay that history, send system-role
messages, enforce native JSON output, or send audio, images, or files.
Custom capabilities cannot enable these unsupported features or disable
multi-turn support. Disabling it would squash local history while the agent
retains the same history. To restore an
existing upstream context on a new target instance, use
`set_conversation_context`. A local history without an upstream context ID
is rejected. `reset_conversation_async` forgets the local mapping; it does
not delete remote state. Sends and resets for the same conversation are
serialized. Different conversations can run concurrently.
`set_conversation_context` raises an error if that conversation is in use.

The target retries submission only after an explicit HTTP 429. Retries use
the same A2A message ID. Rate-limit errors during polling retry only the poll.
Polling honors `Retry-After` (seconds or HTTP date), with exponential backoff
when that header is absent or invalid. The polling deadline bounds these waits.
`max_requests_per_minute` applies to submission attempts and task polls, not
agent-card discovery.
Empty results, task failures, and agent errors that mention a downstream
rate limit do not cause automatic resubmission. A polling timeout does not
cancel the remote task. Do not blindly resubmit an action after a timeout.
`request_timeout_seconds` sets the HTTPX connect, read, write, and pool
timeouts and defaults to `task_timeout_seconds`. These are per-phase
timeouts, not a total turn deadline. Instead, pass HTTPX `timeout` for
per-phase settings or `timeout=None` to disable HTTP timeouts. Do not pass
both timeout options. Timeouts must be finite and positive.
`task_timeout_seconds` is a separate deadline that starts after submission
returns a pending task. It bounds polling, rate-limit waits, and in-flight
poll requests, even with `timeout=None`. `poll_interval_seconds` must be
finite and non-negative.

Identifiers include the endpoint, requested protocol, card path, and optional
`routing_identifier`. Set this non-secret deployment label when HTTP headers
select a different agent at the same endpoint. Do not put tokens in the URL,
card path, or routing label. Credentials, HTTP headers, and timeout settings
are not copied into identifier parameters.

`auth_token` accepts a static token or an async callable that returns a token.
The callable runs before each HTTP request, including discovery, submission
retries, and polls. Use a provider that caches tokens and refreshes them
before expiry. Do not combine `auth_token` with HTTPX `auth` or an
`Authorization` header. Custom HTTPX authentication is supported when
`auth_token` is not set.

For Foundry, keep the credential open for the full target operation:

```python
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
from pyrit.prompt_target import A2ATarget

async with DefaultAzureCredential() as credential:
    token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://ai.azure.com/.default")
    target = A2ATarget(
        endpoint=agent_endpoint,
        protocol_version="auto",
        agent_card_path="agentCard/v1.0",
        auth_token=token_provider,
    )
    responses = await target.send_prompt_async(message=message)
```

### A2A integration tests

The local tests run an official SDK server on an ephemeral loopback port.
They cover 0.3 and 1.0, discovery, persisted multi-turn history, task
continuation, failure, and prevention of duplicate submissions. From a
development environment with the `all` extra, set `RUN_ALL_TESTS=true` and run:

```text
uv run pytest tests/integration/targets/test_a2a_target_integration.py -k "not foundry"
```

The separate Foundry test also requires `RUN_ALL_TESTS=true` and
`A2A_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`. It uses `A2A_FOUNDRY_AUTH_TOKEN` if supplied; otherwise,
it uses a refreshable Entra token provider through `DefaultAzureCredential` for
`https://ai.azure.com/.default`. The identity must have access to the agent
(for example, the Agent Consumer role). `A2A_FOUNDRY_CARD_PATH`
defaults to `agentCard/v1.0`; set it to
`agentCard/v0.3` for a preview endpoint. The test requires a successful text
response, not just a non-empty error. It does not create Azure resources.

## Target Capabilities

Every `PromptTarget` exposes a `TargetConfiguration` (via `target.configuration`) that declares what the target natively supports. This lets attacks, converters, and scorers reason about whether a given target is suitable for a given workflow — and, where possible, adapt automatically when a capability is missing.

A `TargetConfiguration` composes three concerns:

- **`TargetCapabilities`** — an immutable, declarative description of what the target natively supports.
- **`CapabilityHandlingPolicy`** — for each capability that *can* be adapted, whether to `ADAPT` (apply a normalization step to work around the gap) or `RAISE` (fail immediately).
- **`ConversationNormalizationPipeline`** — the ordered set of normalizers derived from the gap between the declared capabilities and the policy.

### Capabilities

`TargetCapabilities` declares the following flags:

| Capability                       | Meaning                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `supports_multi_turn`            | The target accepts and uses conversation history (or maintains state externally, e.g. via a WebSocket).                                  |
| `supports_multi_message_pieces`  | The target accepts more than one `MessagePiece` in a single request (e.g. text + image in one message).                                  |
| `supports_editable_history`      | The conversation history can be modified after the fact. Implies `supports_multi_turn`. Required for attacks that rewrite prior turns.   |
| `supports_system_prompt`         | The target natively supports a system-role message.                                                                                      |
| `supports_json_output`           | The target supports a "json" response format that guarantees valid JSON output.                                                          |
| `supports_json_schema`           | The target supports constraining output to a caller-provided JSON schema.                                                                |
| `input_modalities`               | The set of input modality combinations the target accepts (e.g. `{text}`, `{text, image_path}`).                                         |
| `output_modalities`              | The set of output modality combinations the target produces.                                                                             |

Each target class defines defaults; instances can override individual capabilities when they depend on deployment configuration (e.g. `HTTPTarget`, `PlaywrightTarget`).

For well-known underlying models, you can look up a profile with `get_known_capabilities(underlying_model="gpt-4o")` from `pyrit.prompt_target`.

Tool-call history uses the existing `function_call` and `function_call_output` input
modalities. These describe acceptance of prior calls and results, not tool execution.
See [Target Capabilities](./6_1_target_capabilities.ipynb) for examples.

### How consumers use capabilities

Components that need a particular capability declare it as a `TargetRequirements` and validate at construction time:

```python
from pyrit.prompt_target import CHAT_TARGET_REQUIREMENTS

CHAT_TARGET_REQUIREMENTS.validate(target=target)
```

`TargetRequirements.validate` collects every missing capability and raises a single `ValueError`. For one-off checks against a single capability you can also call `target.configuration.ensure_can_handle(capability=...)` directly.

`TargetRequirements` can also enforce **modality** constraints via `required_input_modalities` and `required_output_modalities`. Each entry is a set of `PromptDataType` values the consumer needs the target to accept (or produce). At least one of the target's modality combos must be a superset of each required combo:

```python
from pyrit.prompt_target import TargetRequirements

# A consumer that requires image input and text output
VISION_REQUIREMENTS = TargetRequirements(
    required_input_modalities=frozenset({frozenset({"image_path"})}),
    required_output_modalities=frozenset({frozenset({"text"})}),
)
VISION_REQUIREMENTS.validate(target=target)
```

### Adapting vs raising

Some capability gaps can be papered over by PyRIT itself. For example, a single-turn target can be made to *appear* multi-turn by flattening the conversation history into a single prompt before sending. The `CapabilityHandlingPolicy` controls this on a per-capability basis:

- `UnsupportedCapabilityBehavior.RAISE` — fail at construction time. This is the safe default.
- `UnsupportedCapabilityBehavior.ADAPT` — run the corresponding normalizer in the conversation pipeline before the target sees the messages.

Non-adaptable capabilities (e.g. `supports_editable_history`) are not represented in the policy at all; requesting them on a target that lacks them always raises.

### Overriding capabilities per instance

For targets whose capabilities depend on deployment (HTTP endpoints, Playwright-driven UIs, custom backends), pass a `TargetConfiguration` to the constructor:

```python
from pyrit.prompt_target.common.target_capabilities import TargetCapabilities
from pyrit.prompt_target.common.target_configuration import TargetConfiguration

config = TargetConfiguration(
    capabilities=TargetCapabilities(
        supports_multi_turn=True,
        supports_editable_history=True,
        supports_system_prompt=True,
    ),
)
target = MyHTTPTarget(custom_configuration=config, ...)
```

The full implementation lives in [`pyrit/prompt_target/common/target_capabilities.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT/blob/main/pyrit/prompt_target/common/target_capabilities.py) and [`pyrit/prompt_target/common/target_configuration.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT/blob/main/pyrit/prompt_target/common/target_configuration.py). For runnable examples — inspecting capabilities on a real target, comparing known model profiles, and `ADAPT` vs `RAISE` in action — see [Target Capabilities](./6_1_target_capabilities.ipynb).

### Discovering live target capabilities

Declared capabilities describe what a target *should* support. For deployments where actual behavior is uncertain — custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, gateways that strip features, models whose support drifts — you can probe what the target *actually* accepts at runtime:

```python
from pyrit.prompt_target import discover_target_capabilities_async

# Probe boolean capabilities and input modalities, returning a
# best-effort TargetCapabilities:
queried = await discover_target_capabilities_async(target=target)
```

Each probe sends a minimal request (bounded by `per_probe_timeout_s`, default 30s, with one retry on transient errors) and only marks a capability or modality as supported if the call returns cleanly. `discover_target_capabilities_async` returns a merged view: probed where possible, declared where probing is unavailable or out of scope. "Supported" here means *the request was accepted* — a target that silently ignores a system prompt or `response_format` directive is still reported as supporting it, so validate response content out of band when the distinction matters. This function is not safe to call concurrently with other operations on the same target instance: it temporarily mutates `target._configuration` and writes probe rows to memory (rows are tagged with `prompt_metadata["capability_probe"] == "1"` for filtering). See [Target Capabilities](./6_1_target_capabilities.ipynb) for runnable examples.

## Multi-Modal Targets

Like most of PyRIT, targets can be multi-modal.

- [OpenAI Chat Target](./1_openai_chat_target.ipynb) (*text + image --> text*)
- [OpenAI Image Target](./3_openai_image_target.ipynb) (*text --> image* or *text + image --> image*)
- [OpenAI Video Target](./4_openai_video_target.ipynb) (*text --> video*)
- [OpenAI TTS Target](./5_openai_tts_target.ipynb) (*text --> audio*)

# # HackAPrompt Target
#
# [HackAPrompt](https://www.hackaprompt.com) is a prompt injection competition. Each challenge gives you a model
# to break and an intent to reach, and a panel of judges run by the platform decides whether a session reached
# it. `HackAPromptTarget` sends prompts to one challenge and can ask that judge panel for its verdict, so the
# challenges can be attacked with PyRIT attacks and scorers instead of the website's chat box.
#
# Only the first cell below runs without credentials. The two that talk to the platform need a signed-in
# HackAPrompt session, so their output is not checked in and this notebook is skipped when the documentation is
# regenerated.

# ## Authentication
#
# HackAPrompt has no API keys. Requests are authenticated with the cookies of a signed-in browser session, and a
# challenge session is identified by a session id that the website creates when you open a challenge. Both values
# are copied out of the browser once and expire when the browser session does.
#
# 1. Sign in at [hackaprompt.com](https://www.hackaprompt.com) and open the challenge you want to attack.
# 2. Open the browser's developer tools (`F12`) and switch to the **Network** tab.
# 3. Send any prompt in the challenge's chat box and select the resulting `chat` request.
# 4. The request **payload** holds `session_id`, `challenge_slug` and `competition_slug`.
# 5. The request **headers** hold the `Cookie` header. Copy the whole header value; it holds the
#    `sb-<project>-auth-token.*` cookies that identify you.
#
# Put the two secrets in your `.env` file, where the target picks them up:
#
# ```
# HACK_A_PROMPT_SESSION_ID="a4d3e38c-..."
# HACK_A_PROMPT_COOKIE="sb-<project>-auth-token.0=...; sb-<project>-auth-token.1=..."
# ```
#
# They can also be passed to the constructor as `session_id` and `cookie` — useful when you refresh them from a
# browser in the same script. Neither ends up in the target identifier that PyRIT writes to memory.

# ## Picking a challenge
#
# `HackAPromptChallenge` lists the text challenges of the CBRNE practice track, the live twin of the CBRNE
# competition track that closed on June 19th. Picking a member fills in both slugs the API needs, and carries
# the rest of what the platform publishes about the challenge: the intents the judges grade against, the models
# the prompt is run against, and whether the challenge takes a single prompt only.

# %%
from pyrit.prompt_target import HackAPromptChallenge

for challenge in HackAPromptChallenge:
    turns = "one prompt" if challenge.one_shot else "conversation"
    models = ", ".join(challenge.models) or "not published"
    print(f"{challenge.name:<33} {challenge.challenge_slug:<35} {turns:<12} {models}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Sending a prompt
#
# One target drives one HackAPrompt challenge session: the platform keeps the transcript on its side, keyed by
# the session id, and the judges grade all of it together. Build a new target — or assign a fresh `session_id`
# copied from a freshly opened challenge page — for every attack run that should be graded on its own.
#
# A challenge the platform does not flag as one-shot is a conversation, so multi-turn attacks such as
# `MultiPromptSendingAttack` and `ChunkedRequestAttack` work against it; a one-shot challenge rejects a
# second turn.
#
# Attacks that rewrite the history as they go — `CrescendoAttack` among them — do not work here, and the
# target does not pretend otherwise. Their `TARGET_REQUIREMENTS` ask for native `EDITABLE_HISTORY`, which
# this target does not declare, so `AttackStrategy.__init__()` raises `ValueError` before anything is sent.
# The transcript belongs to the platform: it is keyed by the session id, it is what the judges grade, and
# nothing sent from here can edit or truncate it. Declaring the capability to get past the check would only
# move the failure somewhere harder to read.

# ## Asking the judges
#
# The attack above runs without a scorer, so PyRIT reports its outcome as undetermined. On HackAPrompt it is the
# platform's own judge panel that decides: `check_challenge_async` submits the session to it and returns its
# verdict unchanged, one entry per judge plus the points the session earned. The judges grade the whole session,
# so call it after the attack has run.

judgement = await target.check_challenge_async()  # type: ignore

    print(f"{judge['name']} passed={judge['passed']}: {judge['judge_response']}")

# ## Other challenges
#
# HackAPrompt has far more challenges than the CBRNE practice track, and new ones appear with every competition.
# Any of them can be attacked by passing its slug together with the slug of the competition it belongs to — both
# are in the payload of the `chat` request, and in the address of the challenge page. This is also how the
# challenges of the closed CBRNE competition track are reached.
#
# ```python
# target = HackAPromptTarget(challenge_slug="jokebot_goes_to_therapy", competition_slug="dougdoug")
# ```

# # Tree of Attacks with Pruning (Multi-Turn) - optional
#
# The `TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack` (aka `TAPAttack`) implements the TAP attack strategy [@mehrotra2023tap].
#
# The TAP attack strategy systematically explores multiple adversarial prompt paths in parallel
# using a tree structure. It employs breadth-first search with pruning to efficiently find
# effective jailbreaks while managing computational resources.
#
# How it works:
# 1. **Initialization**: Creates multiple initial attack branches (width) to explore different approaches
# 2. **Tree Expansion**: For each iteration (depth), branches are expanded by a branching factor
# 3. **Prompt Generation**: Each node generates adversarial prompts via an LLM red-teaming assistant
# 4. **Evaluation**: Responses are evaluated for objective achievement and on-topic relevance
# 5. **Pruning**: Low-scoring or off-topic branches are pruned to maintain the width constraint
# 6. **Iteration**: The process continues until the objective is achieved or max depth is reached
#
# The strategy balances exploration (trying diverse approaches) with exploitation (focusing on
# promising paths) through its pruning mechanism.
#
# Note:
# The TAP attack is particularly effective for complex objectives that benefit from systematic
# exploration. The tree visualization in the result provides insights into the attack's
# decision-making process.
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../../memory/0_memory.md).

# ## Tree of Attacks with Image Generation Targets
#
# TAP can also be used against image generation targets (e.g., DALL-E).
# Key differences when targeting image generators:
#
# 1. **System Prompt**: Use `TAPSystemPromptPaths.IMAGE_GENERATION` to provide
#    an adversarial system prompt tailored for image generation models.
# 2. **Error Handling**: Image generation targets frequently return "blocked"
#    responses due to content filters. PyRIT's default scorers (TrueFalseScorer
#    and FloatScaleScorer) automatically return `False` / `0.0` for blocked
#    responses, so blocked branches receive a score of `0.0` instead of failing
#    the branch — preventing premature pruning of all branches.
# 3. **Scoring**: The default TAP scorer automatically detects the target's output
#    modalities. For image targets, it configures the scorer to accept `image_path`
#    responses. The adversarial chat target (used for scoring) should be a multimodal
#    model (e.g., GPT-4o) so it can evaluate the generated images.
# 4. **Single-Turn Targets**: Image generation targets are typically single-turn.
#    TAP automatically detects this via target capabilities and creates a fresh
#    conversation ID for each prompt, so no special configuration is needed.
